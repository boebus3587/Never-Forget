Few days before the new fiscal year, the company changed OVERTIME payment, pilots who flew under overtime conditions didn't get the proper payment.  

Introduction of  Fake EASA Flight Time Regulation.

" Fly more, I'm in home office " meanwhile pilots are flying abroad exposing their families ( babies, health problem relatives) without any option or being asked if agree to fly in this condition.  

"If you wish, we don't care, face mask are not allowed"  until they change the concept.  


# March  

" In order to maintain business Integrity...company will assign balance annual leave...to pilots from April.
We are confident that you will understand ...this decision.."  

No days off after ULR flights, company is using LEAVE balance to give legal rest.  

Company started removing days off, from the published roster extending duties out of the home base and home base without pilot agreement.  

No payment during rest time while duty ( Bunk Time) although you are working. Doesn't matter if you are suffering exposition to gamma radiation, vibration, noise, dryness, and jetlag.

Bid System doesn't work anymore for especially for Boeing Fleet  

Pilots from the same nationality will not be rostered together unless company requirements creating more instability for the BID System and Roster.
( Flag Carrier companies are in extreme danger, as they have the same nationality )

Fired pilots, few days about to leave the country were invited to perform a physiological test to rejoining the company after the stress of losing the job and relocate the family. 
Some of them failed and most probably do you know the reason! Would you be mentally prepared?  

# April  

777 pilots with balance Leave from the previous fiscal year (2020) were forced to do not take it, no chance to complain.  

" In recognition of your commitment and dedication to support airline.... we will be credit your April salary..." but you don't have chance to see your family outside, keep working... we pay less you work more, great deal!”  

NO answer from Company,  guys are paying from their own pocket waiting in Qatar to rejoin the company.  

If you weren't considered an offender, your RETI fuel was burned for the non-sense flight over Qatar (fully vaccinated people from Doha to Doha), check Instagram.. 

Pilots are exhausted working more than 100h month, LEAVE from May and June were canceled!!! 

Payment:  

ENTIRE COMPANY GOT BACK SALARY BUT...WE STILL  

No payment during rest time while duty ( Bunk Time)
(Cargo) DH on Belly Cargo are not paid

STILL " some redundant pilots " are waiting in Qatar paying expenses from their own pocket to be maybe able to rejoin the company.

Company is not publishing the roster as per approved QCAA – PART A.
